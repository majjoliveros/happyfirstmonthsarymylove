            Hi Love,
        </p>

        <p>
            This was meant to be a surprise gift for you, but I had to relearn web design and had limited time. ðŸ˜„ So bear with me; this is a pretty basic website.
            I want to express my gratitude for everything you do. It's only been a month, but it feels like I've known you forever. You often ask me why I love you, why I chose you over everyone else.
            You'd say, "bakit mo ba ako nagustuhan?" or "bakit ba ako yung pinili mo?" If only you could see yourself the way I do, you'd fall in love with yourself too.
            I've never given you a clear reason, but here's why: you make me feel like I'm not alone; you make me feel safe. I've been strong for years, and I know I can handle everything, but then you came into my life.
            You made me realize it's nice to have someone take care of me, someone I can rely on. I know you often think someone else may be better for me, but I don't want you to feel like you're in competition with anyone, especially someone from my past.
            I chose you over everything else you could offer because I fell in love with you as a person, and I know you're a work in progress (as we both are), but I'm here to work on our dreams together.
            I want to grow with you in this relationship. I believe you're capable of achieving your dreams, and I'll be your cheerleader, partner, and supporter.
            It's been a month, and I keep falling in love with you every day. I love every version of you: the kid, the honest one, the scared one, the loving one, the masculine one, and the feminine one.
            There are things I've never told you. Sometimes, I look at you and wonder how someone as good as you can feel undeserving of the world, unworthy of love, and all the beautiful things life offers.
            I can't take all your worries, but I'll be here every step of the way to make you feel worthy of the love you give to others. In just a month, we've talked through misunderstandings and conflicts in a positive way, and I'd like to keep it that way.
            I know we'll face more challenges, but as long as we're together, there's no battle we can't resolve.
            I'm grateful to have you in my life, and I'll keep reminding you of that. Please take care of yourself so we can have a lifetime together.
            You're the only person I want to stay up late with, have pillow fights with, watch movies with until we lose track of time, cook breakfast and dinner with (although you'll have to teach me first because I don't know how to cook ðŸ˜…), hug, kiss, and hold hands with.
            You, and only you, are the person I want to do everything with. I always pray that we'll end up together, and I'll do everything to keep you and what we have. Mahal na mahal na mahal na mahal kita, mahal ko. I hope you know that. 
            Ikaw at ikaw lang ang palagi kong pipiliin dito sa mundong ito, at kahit pa mahirapan tayo, ilalaban ko lagi yung relationship natin.
